# Automated tool for converting .txt to .md and uploading to Github releases.
>Introducing the automated Markdown file generation tool using Github Actions. This tool streamlines the process of converting a text file into a properly formatted Markdown file. Upon triggering the Github Action, the tool automatically reads the contents of the "text.txt" file located at the root of the repository, converts the newline characters into Markdown line breaks, and outputs the resulting Markdown file. The Markdown file is then uploaded to the repository's release section for easy access and distribution. This tool is perfect for users who want to quickly and efficiently generate Markdown files without having to manually format the text themselves.
